 well  it s been actually more than one year already  and every day it felt very painful  very emotional  hurtful  because i know i didn t do anything wrong and i know i m clean  so it was a shock when i received the letter that my urine test  only the urine test came out positive  with actually an extremely low quantity of substance  banned substance  i ve been always against doping and you know  i ve been loud as well about this  so it didn t even cross my mind in my whole life to do something like this  so it was a shock  i struggled with the emotional part because it s been very heavy on my shoulders and seeing this so much in the public  it was really affecting my mental health  for sure  well  the support has been amazing  the fans who are supporting me unconditionally  which means a lot  it means a huge amount to see the people  even if i m facing the worst moment in my life as an athlete i know i m clean  i received tonnes of messages  good messages  and the biggest thing is that i ve never faced a person who told me something negative  so all of them were positive  and this gave me the strength to keep fighting every day  to clear my name and to show that i didn t do anything wrong  the players also  which are opponents  they also showed their support and i really appreciate it because it means a lot  we are fighting on court and when you are in the worst situation  they are there and they support you  also the legends  i had such a big support from legends in tennis and they were also publicly speaking about me and this means a lot  they were supporting me fully and it s great  it s huge  everything helps me to stay strong in these difficult times and to fight to clear my name  well  yeah  they said that  but it s very clear that it was a contamination  three days before the positive urine test  i was negative in blood and urine  so i ve been told at the beginning that it s a very  it s an extremely low quantity of this substance  banned substance  and in those three days i could not have doped  it was not my intention and never has been the intention to do something wrong or something disrespectful to this sport  because i have respected everything and i dedicated my life  my principles are not like this  so i didn t think to cheat in tennis  the two things that    the contamination  i think it s very strong for me  and the second one  the blood  i had many  many tests and all of them were negative  so they never found anything wrong in my blood  so with these two things  i feel confident going and facing cas  court of arbitration for sport   yeah  i think it s way too long to wait for an athlete  a professional athlete  i accepted i had nothing to do against this and now i m looking forward to february when finally i will have the final decision  it s true that he went out  i wish he could have done that a little bit earlier  i have stopped working with the academy for a while already  i m just  you know    when i found myself in this situation  it was difficult to manage because i have always trusted in my teams  previous teams and everybody that i work with because i felt like trusting  you have a better chance to perform at your maximum  and i ve always been open to learn from people  that s why you hire people  because you need the information  you need to be better  so i always trusted this and my trust is broken a little bit right now  and in the future  i don t know how it s going to be  if i can trust again  and probably i have to learn  because this is my principle in life  if you hire somebody and you work with that person  you have to trust  not very soon  like a few months ago  i think so  yeah  because four years is going to be a lot  for my age at least  and for an athlete who has done this thing every day for 25 years and dedicated their life to tennis and to sport i don t know how it s going to be  but it s catastrophic if it s going to be four years  and i don t know how i will handle it  probably  it s going to be the end of my career  yes  and for something that i didn t do and that is not my fault  it s even more catastrophic  well  for the kids  the only thing i can say is that they have to dream big  i think this is the most important thing to visualise yourself with the big trophies  of course  you never know what is going to happen in life  but if you dedicate yourself to sport  if you are disciplined  if you work hard  and if you have the passion  the big passion for this sport  i think you are able  one day  to lift those trophies  i did this and i can share this with them  they have to have the courage to trust themselves and to go forward  i know some days are difficult because you don t feel like going there  you feel tired  you feel exhausted  you feel depressed sometimes  but if you push yourself and you go on court in those days  the step is huge  and i wish them good luck and to trust in themselves  to have confidence inside them  of course  this is my dream  i know there are not big chances for this  but i m dreaming of this because paris is my dream city  i won roland garros here when i was a junior  so everything started very early  and it will be amazing to be back on court  no matter what  but i just want to be on court because that s where i belong and i feel like i want to do it again  thank you  too  for listening and for talking to me
